# Churn-Bank-Customers

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. Customer churn, or customer attrition, is a critical metric for businesses, especially in the banking sector. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to leave, banks can take proactive measures to retain valuable clients.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to bank customers, including:

- CreditScore
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- NumOfProducts
- HasCrCard
- IsActiveMember
- EstimatedSalary

The target variable is 'Exited', which indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook, which allows for an interactive and step-by-step approach to data analysis and model building. The main steps in the notebook include:

1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Selection and Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Visualization of Results

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Churn-Bank-Customers.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
